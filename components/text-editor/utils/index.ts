 * Returns a function that will execute all functions passed when called. It is generally used

 * as React's useEffect hook.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   return mergeRegister(
 *     editor.registerCommand(...registerCommand1 logic),
 *     editor.registerCommand(...registerCommand2 logic),
 *     editor.registerCommand(...registerCommand3 logic)
 *   )
 * }, [editor])
 * ```
 * In this case, useEffect is returning the function returned by mergeRegister as a cleanup
 * function to be executed after either the useEffect runs again (due to one of its dependencies
 * updating) or the component it resides in unmounts.
 * Note the functions don't neccesarily need to be in an array as all arguements
 * are considered to be the func argument and spread from there.
 * @param func - An array of functions meant to be executed by the returned function.
 * @returns the function which executes all the passed register command functions.
